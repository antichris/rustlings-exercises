# Rustlings guide solutions

These are my solutions to the exercises of the [Rustlings guide][rustlings] at version [5.0.0].

The only resources I used in coming up with these was the [Book] and an occasional hint from the `rustlings`. Even though these might not be the most idiomatic solutions, as far as making stuff to compile and the tests to pass, this gets the job done.

This repository is branch-filtered to the `exercises` subdirectory of [Rustlings 5.0.0][5.0.0] with the history limited to a depth of 1, and the [original contents of its `README.md` are here][readme-orig].
